**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Please make sure it's not a bug in podman (in that case report it to podman)
or your understanding of docker-compose or how rootless containers work (for example, it's normal for rootless container not to be able to listen for port less than 1024 like 80)

please try to reproduce the bug in latest devel branch

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. what is the content of the current working directory (ex. `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `Dockerfile`, ...etc.)
2. what is the sequence of commands you typed

please use [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for example give me a small busybox-based compose yaml


**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Actual behavior**
What is the behavior you actually got and that should not happen.


**Output**
